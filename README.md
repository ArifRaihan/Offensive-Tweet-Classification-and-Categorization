# Offensive Tweet Classification and Categorization 
Using the annotated OLID dataset for offensive tweets, I have used python and the deep learning framwork Keras to build the models for completing two tasks -

1) Build a classifier that classifies tweets as Offensive and Not Offensive

2. Build a classifier for Subtasks A-C combined, treating this as one single multi-class problem. There are 5 possible classes:
NOT, OFF-UNT, OFF-TIN-IND, OFF-TIN-GRP, OFF-TIN-OTH
